# odin-recipes
Simple website with barebones HTML compiling a few recipes of protein packed meals.

Major lesson from creating this website was familiarizing myself with the git workflow.
Adding changes after any major revision, commiting with a clear and concise message, and finalizing by pushing to github.
Afterwards, checking 'git status' for any changes that need to be added, and 'git log' for previous commit messages.

I hope to continue my web development journey by adding some spice to my websites with colourful CSS and simple, yet elegant JavaScript.
